# Planet-Moon-DataStructure
Develop a structure to represent planets in the solar system. Each planet has fields for the planetâ€™s name, its distance from the sun in miles and the number of moons it has. Write a program to read data for each planet and store. Also print the planet that has highest number of moons.
